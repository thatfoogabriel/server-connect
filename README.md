# server-connect
### TCP socket programming practice
Run in cmd  
Run server file first  
Run client file with integer value in args[0]  
(ex: \server-connect-main> java Client 5)  
  
1. Opens TCP socket between Server and Client  
2. Client sends its name and input number to Server  
3. Server and Client names and numbers are displayed on both sides  
4. Sum of Server's random number and Client's input number are displayed on both sides
